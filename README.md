# Sigma ML- Quiz 3

This project demonstrates various image processing techniques using OpenCV, such as contrast enhancement, mask extraction, edge detection, and segmentation using the GrabCut algorithm. The tasks are performed on a sample portrait image.

## Features
- **Contrast Enhancement**: Uses Histogram Equalization on the HSV Value channel to improve contrast.
- **Mask Extraction**: Applies Otsu's Thresholding to extract the person's binary mask.
- **Edge Detection**: Extracts edges using both Morphological Gradient and the Canny Edge Detector.
- **Image Segmentation**: Utilizes OpenCV's GrabCut algorithm to segment the foreground (person) from the background.
